# Parameter reliability

## Overview

This project serves as a follow-up to the studies of Vanhasbroeck et
al. (2024) and Yu et al. (2025) in which we investigated the reliability
of the measurement of affect and perception respectively. Common across
these two studies is the use of computational models to investigate this
reliability. However, after additional thought, we both agreed that such
an analysis may be faulty when models are misspecified.

Within this project, then, we investigate to which extent we can rely on
parameter estimates for misspecified models with the goal of detecting
misspecification based on the reliability with which parameters are
estimated across different blocks of experimental stimuli and/or by
making the mechanisms with which misspecified models compensate for the
misspecification explicit.

## Installation

To run the analyses in the script `simulation.R`, you need to first
install the package that comes with this project. To do so, you should
run:

    remotes::install_github("ndpvh/parameter-reliability")

You can then load these function through calling `library`,
specifically:

    library(paramrel)

## Usage
